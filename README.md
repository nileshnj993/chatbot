# chatbot
This is a primitive chatbot created using Python libraries such as ChatterBot and the corpus that comes along with it. Basic html, css and js have been used for the front end design and serving get requests. Flask has been used to host it.

To access it, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/njmit123/chatbot.git` and run `python3 main.py` on your terminal, to host it on http://localhost:5000.
